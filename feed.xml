One such challenge involves the integration of Nginx and uWSGI, especially when dealing with Unix sockets and permission issues. In this blog post, we’ll explore a real-life scenario where Nginx was unable to connect to a uWSGI socket, leading to a “Permission Denied” error. We’ll walk through the problem and provide a step-by-step guide to diagnose and solve these issues.</p> <h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2> <p>The error in question was logged by Nginx as follows:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2024/01/28 23:10:39 [crit] 223649#223649: *2 connect() to unix:/home/ubuntu/myFlashCards/computer-science-flash-cards/flash_cards.sock failed (13: Permission denied) while connecting to upstream...
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This error indicated that Nginx, acting as a reverse proxy, was unable to connect to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flash_cards.sock</code> Unix socket used by a uWSGI application. This type of error is typically a result of incorrect permissions or ownership settings on the socket file or the directories leading to it.</p> <h2 id="step-by-step-diagnosis-and-resolution">Step-by-Step Diagnosis and Resolution</h2> <h3 id="step-1-check-socket-file-permissions">Step 1: Check Socket File Permissions</h3> <p>The first step is to inspect the permissions of the socket file:</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">ls</span> <span class="nt">-l</span> /home/ubuntu/myFlashCards/computer-science-flash-cards/flash_cards.sock
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The output showed correct permissions (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">srw-rw----</code>) and ownership (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ubuntu:www-data</code>), indicating that the socket file itself was not the issue.</p> <h3 id="step-2-examine-directory-permissions">Step 2: Examine Directory Permissions</h3> <p>Next, we checked the permissions of the directories containing the socket file:</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">ls</span> <span class="nt">-ld</span> /home/ubuntu
<span class="nb">ls</span> <span class="nt">-ld</span> /home/ubuntu/myFlashCards
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The output revealed a potential issue:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>drwxr-x--- 8 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Jan 28 23:10 /home/ubuntu
drwxrwxr-x 3 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Jan 28 22:56 /home/ubuntu/myFlashCards
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/ubuntu</code> directory had restricted permissions, preventing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">www-data</code> user (under which Nginx runs) from accessing the socket file inside it.</p> <h3 id="step-3-adjusting-permissions">Step 3: Adjusting Permissions</h3> <p>To resolve this, we modified the permissions of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/ubuntu</code> directory to allow traversal by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">www-data</code> user:</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">chmod </span>o+x /home/ubuntu
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This command added execute permission for others, enabling the necessary traversal access.</p> <h3 id="step-4-restart-services">Step 4: Restart Services</h3> <p>After adjusting the permissions, both Nginx and uWSGI services were restarted to apply the changes:</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>systemctl restart nginx
<span class="nb">sudo </span>systemctl restart your_uwsgi_service  <span class="c"># Replace with your specific uWSGI service name</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <h3 id="step-5-verify-the-solution">Step 5: Verify the Solution</h3> <p>Finally, we checked the Nginx error logs again to confirm that the “Permission Denied” error was resolved.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>Dealing with Nginx and uWSGI can sometimes be challenging, especially when it comes to permissions and access control. In this instance, a seemingly complex problem was resolved by a simple change in directory permissions. It’s a good reminder of the importance of understanding the underlying system’s architecture and permissions when managing web servers.</p> <p>Remember, always approach such changes with caution, especially in a production environment, to avoid unintended security risks. Happy troubleshooting!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="posts"/><category term="Nginx"/><category term="uWSGI"/><category term="Troubleshooting"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diagnosing and solving Nginx and uWSGI permission issues]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Optuna</title><link href="https://imilesho.github.io/blog/2024/Optuna/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Optuna"/><published>2024-01-24T16:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-01-24T16:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://imilesho.github.io/blog/2024/Optuna</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://imilesho.github.io/blog/2024/Optuna/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="optuna-a-hyperparameter-optimization-framework"><a href="&quot;https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html&quot;">Optuna: A hyperparameter optimization framework</a></h2> <p>Optuna is an automatic hyperparameter optimization software framework, particularly designed for machine learning.

With IAM, you can centrally manage permissions that control which AWS resources users can access. You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.</p> <h3 id="iam-gives-you-the-following-features">IAM gives you the following features:</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Shared access to your AWS account You can grant other people permission to administer and use resources in your AWS account without having to share your password or access key.</p> </li> <li> <p>Granular permissions You can grant different permissions to different people for different resources.</p> </li> <li> <p>Secure access to AWS resources for applications that run on Amazon EC2 You can use IAM features to securely provide credentials for applications that run on EC2 instances. These credentials provide permissions for your application to access other AWS resources. Examples include S3 buckets and DynamoDB tables.</p> </li> <li> <p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) You can add two-factor authentication to your account and to individual users for extra security.</p> </li> <li> <p>Identity federation You can allow users who already have passwords elsewhere—for example, in your corporate network or with an internet identity provider—to get temporary access to your AWS account.</p> </li> <li> <p>Identity information for assurance If you use AWS CloudTrail, you receive log records that include information about those who made requests for resources in your account. That information is based on IAM identities.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="what-is-iam-identity-center"><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">What is IAM Identity Center?</a></h2> <p>AWS IAM Identity Center is the recommended AWS service for managing human user access to AWS resources. It is a single place where you can assign your workforce users, also known as workforce identities, consistent access to multiple AWS accounts and applications.</p> <p>With IAM Identity Center, you can create or connect workforce users and centrally manage their access across all their AWS accounts and applications. You can use multi-account permissions to assign your workforce users access to AWS accounts. You can use application assignments to assign your users access to AWS managed and customer managed applications.</p> <h3 id="iam-identity-center-includes-the-following-core-capabilities-and-features">IAM Identity Center includes the following core capabilities and features:</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Manage workforce identities Human users who build or operate workloads in AWS are also known as workforce users, or workforce identities. Workforce users are employees or contractors who you allow to access AWS accounts in your organization and internal business applications.</p> </li> <li> <p>Manage instances of IAM Identity Center IAM Identity Center supports two types of instances: organization instances and account instances. An organization instance is the best practice. It’s the only instance that enables you to manage access to AWS accounts and it’s recommended for all production use of applications. An organization instance is deployed in the AWS Organizations management account and gives you a single point from which to manage user access across the AWS environment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Manage access to multiple AWS accounts With multi-account permissions, you can plan for and centrally implement permissions across multiple AWS accounts at one time without needing to configure each of your accounts manually.</p> </li> <li> <p>Manage access to applications IAM Identity Center enables you to simplify application access management. With IAM Identity Center, you can grant your workforce users in IAM Identity Center single sign-on access to applications.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-iam-and-iam-identity-center">What is the difference between IAM and IAM Identity Center?</h3> <p>AWS IAM Identity Center, formerly known as AWS Single Sign-On (SSO), is a different service from AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), although they both deal with identity and access control within AWS environments. Here are the key differences.</p> <h4 id="aws-identity-and-access-management-iam">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM):</h4> <ul> <li>IAM allows you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources.</li> <li>IAM is focused on providing fine-grained access control to resources in a single AWS account, with the ability to extend to multiple accounts if necessary.</li> <li>IAM policies define permissions and can be applied to users, groups, or roles within AWS to control what actions a user or system can perform on which resources.</li> <li>IAM is a fundamental component of AWS and does not support federation with external identity providers out of the box; additional setup is needed for that.</li> </ul> <h4 id="iam-identity-center-formerly-aws-sso">IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO):</h4> <ul> <li>IAM Identity Center is designed to simplify the process of managing SSO access to multiple AWS accounts and applications. It allows users to sign in to a central portal with a single set of credentials and access all of their assigned AWS accounts and third-party applications. It integrates with external identity providers, such as Microsoft Active Directory, Azure AD, and Okta, making it easier to manage users across an organization.</li> <li>IAM Identity Center provides a user portal where end-users can find and access all their assigned AWS accounts, cloud applications, and custom applications in one place.</li> <li>It allows for centralized control over who can access what across multiple AWS accounts within AWS Organizations. It can also set up SSO for SAML 2.0 compatible services.</li> </ul> <p>In summary, IAM is a core AWS service for access control within AWS accounts, while IAM Identity Center extends this capability to provide an easy-to-use SSO solution that supports centralized access management across multiple AWS accounts and business applications. IAM Identity Center is particularly useful for organizations that need a unified user experience and centralized permission management across a broad and diverse environment.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="posts"/><category term="Tools"/><category term="AWS"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[About AWS Sign-In]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Activation Functions in Deep Learning</title><link href="https://imilesho.github.io/blog/2024/deeplearning-activaiton-functions/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Activation Functions in Deep Learning"/><published>2024-01-18T12:10:10+00:00</published><updated>2024-01-18T12:10:10+00:00</updated><id>https://imilesho.github.io/blog/2024/deeplearning-activaiton-functions</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://imilesho.github.io/blog/2024/deeplearning-activaiton-functions/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-activation-functions-in-deep-learning">The Activation Functions in Deep Learning</h1> <h2 id="what-is-activation-functions">What is Activation Functions?</h2> <p>Activation functions are mathematical equations that determine the output of a neural network.

In Unix-like operating systems, the root directory is represented by a forward slash (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code>). <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.</code> represents the current directory, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">..</code> represents the parent directory. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd ..</code> changes the current directory to the parent directory. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd /</code> changes the current directory to the root directory. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd .</code> does nothing because it changes the current directory to the current directory. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd ../..</code> changes the current directory to the grandparent directory. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd ~</code> changes the current directory to the home directory. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd -</code> changes the current directory to the previous directory.</li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mkdir</code>: Make directory</li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">touch</code>: Create file. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">touch index.html</code> creates an empty file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code>. If the file already exists, it updates the file’s last modified date.</li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rm</code>: Remove file. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rm index.html</code> removes the file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code>. If the file doesn’t exist, it does nothing. If the file is a directory, it removes the directory and all its contents. You can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-r</code> option to remove a directory and all its contents recursively. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rm -r directory</code> removes the directory named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">directory</code> and all its contents.</li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cp</code>: Copy file. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cp index.html about.html</code> copies the file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> to a new file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">about.html</code>. If the file already exists, it overwrites the file. If the file doesn’t exist, it creates a new file. If the file is a directory, it copies the directory and all its contents.</li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mv</code>: Move file.</li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat</code>: Print file contents. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat index.html</code> prints the contents of the file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code>. If the file doesn’t exist, it does nothing.</li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">man &lt;command&gt;</code>: Show manual for command. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">man ls</code> shows the manual for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command.</li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clear</code>: Clear terminal screen.</li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exit</code>: Exit terminal</li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">history</code>: Show command history</li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">echo</code>: Print text to terminal.

For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tail index.html</code> prints the last 10 lines of the file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code>. You can specify the number of lines to print using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-n</code> option. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tail -n 20 index.html</code> prints the last 20 lines of the file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code>. Or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tail -n1</code> prints the last line of the file.</li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">date</code>: Print current date and time.</li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep</code>: Search for text in file. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep "Hello" index.html</code> searches for the text <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Hello</code> in the file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code>. You can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-i</code> option to make the search case-insensitive.</li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|</code>: Pipe. It takes the output of one command and uses it as input for another command. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls | grep .html</code> lists all files in the current directory that end with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.html</code>.</li> </ul> <h2 id="2-the-ls--l-command-and-file-permissions">2.

Here’s a guide to help you navigate these concepts.</p> <h3 id="file-system-basics">File System Basics</h3> <p>A file system is a method for storing and organizing files on a storage device. It defines how data is stored, retrieved, and updated. The Unix file system is hierarchical, meaning it uses directories to organize files into a tree structure. The root directory is the top-level directory, and all other directories are subdirectories of the root directory.</p> <p>In Unix-like operating systems, the root directory is represented by a forward slash (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code>). For example, the path <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/Users/username/Documents</code> refers to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Documents</code> directory in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">username</code> directory in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Users</code> directory in the root directory.</p> <h3 id="inodes">Inodes</h3> <p>An inode is a data structure that stores metadata about a file. It contains information like the file’s size, owner, permissions, and timestamps. Each file has an inode, and the inode number uniquely identifies the file. When you create a file, the operating system allocates an inode and assigns it a number. The inode number is not visible to the user, but you can see it using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -i</code> command.</p> <div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">(</span>base<span class="o">)</span> ~/MyWorkSpace/Sep769_project&gt; <span class="nb">ls</span> <span class="nt">-i</span>
