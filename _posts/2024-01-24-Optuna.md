## [Optuna: A hyperparameter optimization framework]("https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html")
Optuna is an automatic hyperparameter optimization software framework, particularly designed for machine learning. It features an imperative, define-by-run style user API. Thanks to our define-by-run API, the code written with Optuna enjoys high modularity, and the user of Optuna can dynamically construct the search spaces for the hyperparameters.

# Key Features
Optuna has modern functionalities as follows:

- Lightweight, versatile, and platform agnostic architecture

- Handle a wide variety of tasks with a simple installation that has few requirements.

- Pythonic search spaces

- Define search spaces using familiar Python syntax including conditionals and loops.

- Efficient optimization algorithms

- Adopt state-of-the-art algorithms for sampling hyperparameters and efficiently pruning unpromising trials.

- Easy parallelization

- Scale studies to tens or hundreds of workers with little or no changes to the code.

- Quick visualization

- Inspect optimization histories from a variety of plotting functions.
