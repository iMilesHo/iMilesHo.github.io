1. Here's a shorter response:

Dear George and Tina,

Thank you for your warm New Year's wishes! We're all doing well as we start the new semester.

We're truly grateful for the wonderful Christmas dinner and your company. It was a memorable day for us too. The pictures are a delightful reminder of our time together.

Wishing you all a fantastic year ahead!

Best,
Yuanlai(Miles)
