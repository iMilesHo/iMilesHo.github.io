## Apache License, Version 2.0

We can use open-source code licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (ALv2), in a commercial product for free. The Apache License is one of the permissive open-source licenses, allowing you to use, modify, and distribute the licensed software in both open-source and proprietary projects. Here are some key points about using ALv2 licensed software in commercial products:

### Permissive License: 

ALv2 is a permissive license, meaning it allows for broad freedom with the software, including commercial use, without a significant burden of requirements compared to copyleft licenses (like GPL).

### Commercial Use Allowed: 
You can use, modify, and distribute the original or modified software for any purpose, including commercial, without having to pay royalties to the original authors.

###  Redistribution: 
When you redistribute the code or derivative works, you need to include a copy of the Apache License, provide a notice that you have modified the original software (if applicable), and include any NOTICE file provided with the original software. These requirements are designed to ensure proper attribution and to inform recipients of the terms under which the software is provided.

### Patent Grant: 
The license includes an express grant of patent rights from contributors to users, protecting you against patent claims from contributors related to their contributions to the software.

### No Warranty: 
Like most open-source software, the Apache-licensed software is provided "as is," without warranties of any kind. The responsibility for assessing the software's suitability and managing any risks associated with its use lies with you.

### Liability: 
The license limits the liability of contributors for any damages that may arise from the use of the software.

The Apache License's permissions, conditions, and limitations are designed to encourage the use of Apache-licensed software in both open-source and proprietary projects, making it a popular choice for commercial applications. However, it is always a good practice to review the license terms yourself or consult with legal counsel to ensure your intended use complies with the license and to understand any obligations it may impose.
