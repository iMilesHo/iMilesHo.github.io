# How to Gracefully Add a Final Message to Online Conversations

## In a Formal or Professional Setting

When your conversation is more on the professional side, clarity and politeness are key. Here’s how you can add that last piece of information:

1. **"Before signing off, I would like to add..."** - This preface is courteous and signals that you are concluding with an important point.
2. **"Just one more thing before we conclude..."** - It’s a respectful way to signal that you have a final point to make, showing that you value the other person's time.
3. **"Lastly, I'd like to mention..."** - This transition smoothly directs attention to your closing remarks, wrapping up the conversation neatly.
4. **"Before we end, I want to ensure we've covered..."** - This is particularly useful for ensuring all critical points have been discussed, demonstrating thoroughness and attention to detail.
5. **"In closing, I'd like to add a final note..."** - A clear indication that your next point will conclude the conversation, perfect for summarizing or emphasizing an important takeaway.

## In an Informal or Casual Setting

Casual conversations afford more flexibility, but it’s still important to be considerate:

1. **"Oh, just one more thing before we wrap up..."** - This informal sign-off is friendly and light, ideal for conversations with friends or casual acquaintances.
2. **"Before we call it a day, I remembered..."** - A relaxed way to introduce a final thought, implying a laid-back and spontaneous addition.
3. **"Oh, by the way, before we finish..."** - Perfect for adding something that just came to mind, maintaining a conversational and casual tone.
4. **"Almost forgot to mention..."** - Implies that what you’re about to say is a casual afterthought, keeping the mood light.
5. **"One last thing before we go..."** - A straightforward, no-frills way to introduce your final point in a friendly manner.

## Adding a Follow-Up

Sometimes, your final message might be about continuing the conversation at a later time:

1. **"Let's touch base on this later."** - Indicates a desire to revisit the discussion, showing ongoing engagement.
2. **"I'll follow up with more details."** - A commitment to provide further information, demonstrating reliability.
3. **"Expect an email from me with further information."** - Sets the expectation for continued communication, ensuring the recipient looks out for more details.

## Expressing Appreciation

No matter the setting, ending on a note of gratitude can enhance your message:

1. **"Thanks for your time, and also..."** - Acknowledges the other person’s investment in the conversation before adding your final point.
2. **"I appreciate your patience, and one more thing..."** - Shows gratitude for the recipient's attention and engagement.
3. **"Thank you for the discussion. Additionally..."** - A polite way to both appreciate the conversation and add a concluding remark.
