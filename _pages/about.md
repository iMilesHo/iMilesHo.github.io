* I am actively seeking Co-op or internship opportunities in the summer or fall to contribute effectively to innovative and challenging projects.
* I’m currently studying as a graduate student at McMaster University majoring in Engineering of Systems and Technology. 
* Before that, I worked as a software developer at an automobile company in China for nearly 2 years after I finished my bachelor’s degree in computer science and technology at Beijing Jiaotong University. I got a lot of experience at my last job.
* I also learned a lot at McMaster regarding my English and professional knowledge. Now, I’m looking for a career in my area.
