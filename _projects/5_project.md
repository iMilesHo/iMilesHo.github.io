## In summary

- Developed a user‐friendly iOS interface for the vehicle’s self‐parking feature using Swift and UIKit, adopting
a finite state machine approach to enhance UI reliability, integrating MQTT protocols for real‐time control
communication and managing RESTful API interactions and data parsing with Alamofire, a robust HTTP networking
library, while adhering to MVC principles for code maintainability.
- Refactored parts of a major iOS app, leading to a 10% reduction in code and 20% faster third‐party library integration,
by developing and managing CocoaPod, a dependency manager, aligned components on the company’s
private GitLab, significantly enhancing code reusability and maintainability.
- Streamlined iOS app packaging and deployment for testing and App Store release, adopting TestFlight, an Apple
tool, for efficient beta testing and crash logging, reducing the development cycle by two steps and enhancing
collaboration with backend and automotive teams with the responsibility for troubleshooting app bugs.
